# MEMFAULT_EXAMPLE_FOTA_nrf7002dk
A working poc of 2025 Memfault FOTA on nrf7002dk . Most of the nrf and memfault documentation and examples were failing to build so this example serves as an interim eference to FOTA over wifi for nrf7002dk

A bug / or a crucial piece of FOTA is left out in this example obviously I want you to figure it out on your own and feel happy about discovering it yourself and fixing it!! 😉
